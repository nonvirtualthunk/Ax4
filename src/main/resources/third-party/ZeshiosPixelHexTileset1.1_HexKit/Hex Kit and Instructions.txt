Hex Kit Instructions:
Extract the zip file whereever you want it. Load Hex Kit and select 'Import Tiles' from the File menu. Select the Pixel Tileset folder. Do not adjust the tile settings, simply click 'Save' on the import tool without adjusting the tiles. The tiles may look like they're outside of the import boundry, but that is because the hex tiles have objects that poke over the hex edge.


Import Settings Outside of Hex Kit: 
These tiles were created to be visually appealing- as such, some tiles have objects sticking out of their respective hex (like towering mountains!). The images are saved as 96x96 pixels, but should be treated as 84x96 pixel images for the sake of hex sizing.

Size: 84x96 pixels
Hex Alignment: Horizontal
Tile Side Length: 48 pixels
Render Order: Right down
Offset: None (These are perfectly aligned pixel hexes)
